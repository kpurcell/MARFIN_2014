## Project Objectives:
* Characterize the temporal and spatial dynamics of incidental catc within the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery.  
* Identify the location of bycatch hotspots within the western Gulf of Mexico for total bycatch, and specifically for several federally managed finfish species including Red Snapper, Vermillian Snapper, Greater Amberjack, King Mackeral and Spanish Mackeral.  
* Evaluate the correlation between the bycatch estimates derived from fishery-independent and fishery-dependent sources.  
* Estimate the effect of shrimping effort on the spatial dyanmics of incidental catch using a variable coefficient generalized additive modeling framework.  


## Describe work to be performed:
+Into
Incidental catch of non-target resources, bycatch, is a conservation [@kelleher2005discards via Sims2008] and management concern [@Gardner2008spatial].

Of particlular concern for fishing gears with indiscrinante targeting (eg longline, trawls) [@Gardner2008spatial]



+Proposition
Fleet dynamics are spatially heterogeneous and the little is known about the relationship between the spatial distribution of fishery effort and the spatial distribution of fishery bycatch.  In this study we aim to examine the relationship between the spatial and temporal distribution of both shrimp fishery effort and observer reported fishery bycatch, to better understand the relationship b
